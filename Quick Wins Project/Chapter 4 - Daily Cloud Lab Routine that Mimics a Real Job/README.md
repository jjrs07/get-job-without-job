ðŸ“˜ Chapter 4 Quick Win: Daily Cloud Lab Routine
This quick win helps you build real-world cloud skills through a repeatable 5-day AWS practice schedule.
Each day simulates tasks a junior cloud or DevOps engineer would face on the jobâ€”using only the AWS Free Tier.

Youâ€™ll focus on one core AWS service per day (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, VPC) and track your progress using a simple lab journal. The goal is to build consistency, documentation habits, and confidenceâ€”just like a real cloud professional.

ðŸ§¾ Whatâ€™s Inside
A 5-day lab template that mimics real-world cloud work

Daily tracking prompts (what you did, what failed, what youâ€™d change)

Reflection prompts to build clarity and confidence

A bonus task using CloudWatch + SNS for alerting
